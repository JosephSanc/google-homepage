This file will mirror that front end page of Google using HTML and CSS elements.
This will only only be the front end page, meaning that there is no back end
behavior. At the end of this small project, I will have mostly copied the appearance
of the Google homepage by using recently learned HTML, CSS, developer tools, and GIT.
